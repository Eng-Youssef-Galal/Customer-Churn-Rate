# Customer-Churn-Rate
This repository contains code and resources for predicting churn rate using logistic regression and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in deep learning. Additionally, a Streamlit app has been created to provide a user-friendly interface for performing churn rate predictions.

## Introduction

Churn rate refers to the rate at which customers or subscribers stop using a product or service. Predicting churn rate is vital for businesses to identify and retain customers. This project aims to provide a churn rate prediction solution using two different approaches: logistic regression and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in deep learning.



## Logistic Regression Model
The logistic regression model is a popular method for binary classification tasks like churn rate prediction. It estimates the probability of an event occurring using a logistic function. In this project, the logistic regression model is implemented using Python and scikit-learn library.

## Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a deep learning model that mimics the structure and functioning of the human brain. It consists of multiple interconnected layers of artificial neurons. In this project, an ANN is implemented using Python and the Keras library, which is built on top of TensorFlow.

## Streamlit App

A Streamlit app has been developed to provide an interactive interface for churn rate prediction. Streamlit is a popular Python library for building web applications with simple and intuitive syntax. The app allows users to upload a dataset, select a model (logistic regression or ANN), and perform churn rate predictions.
